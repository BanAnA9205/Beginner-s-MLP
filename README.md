# Beginner's MLP
Simple toy for simple mind.

Thanks Dariel Dato-on for the dataset to train my model. Dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv

The whole project lies in the "neural network.rar" file.

I have also included a "model.txt" file, which is the best model I've trained on 30000 samples, scoring barely above 90% in the testing phase.
